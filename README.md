## UX

The typical website user is interested in sourcing local farm products.

The site owners goal is to promote products that is for sale in the local farm shop and administrator reservations from website users.

- As an admin user, I would like to [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) my products to the website so my customers can see what the farm shop currently sells.
- As a user, I would like to click and collect items for later pickup in the farm shop, so I know items are available when I visit the shop on site.
- As an admin, I would like to [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) all click and collect so I can see all reservations and remove reservations.
- As a user, I would like to login to the site and see my click and collect, so I can follow up on what I have for pickups.
- As an admin, I would like to login to the site, so I can administer products, click and collects & users.
- As an admin, I would like to comment on the click and collect, so I can let other admins know if there is anything to mention.

Site screenshots are found in the project folder [/wireframes](wireframes).
