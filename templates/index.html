        Our family has been in farming for over one hundred years and we took
        over the care of Tapnell and East Afton Farms in 1982. At its peak, the
        farm milked 800 cows and produced 24,000 litres of fresh wholesome milk
        365 days of the year, no exceptions!
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, we no longer milk cows at Tapnell, but the Farm has become the
        Isle of Wight’s leading eco-tourism business and home to award-winning
        Tom’s Eco Lodge, Tapnell Farm Park attraction, The Cow Restaurant & Bar
        - and opening this summer, the Isle of Wight's only outdoor Aqua Park!
      </p>
      <p>
        Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do, whether taking water
        from our bore hole to supply the farm, using the sun to make electricity
        for hundreds of homes, powering our heating systems with our biomass
        boiler or growing over 30 acres of new woodland and hedgerows. It’s
        ingrained in everything we do.
      </p>
      <p>
        The golden rule for us is to pass on our farm in better environmental
        and productive health than it was at the beginning of our life’s tenure.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s still much to do and we are certainly up for the challenge!
      </p>
      <p>
        Sitting on the site of the 1970 Isle of Wight pop festival, our farm is
        surrounded by a patchwork of fields that form the pasture and meadows of
        the countryside, which gently undulate with Tapnell Down to the south
        and Hamstead Heritage Coast and coastal woodlands to the north. The
        picturesque chalk down grassland and forests to the south are not only
        part of the protected landscape but are also Sites of Special Scientific
        Interest and described by Natural England as being “probably the best
        example in Britain of chalk grassland under maritime influence.
